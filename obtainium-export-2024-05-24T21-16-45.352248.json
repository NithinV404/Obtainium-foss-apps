It was disabled in the last couple of versions due to ffmpeg changes. Dolby Atmos audio is also restored. Note that for ARM/ARM64 builds, it is still disabled, due to incompatibilities with how Chromium loads the `libffmpeg` library. Android support is dependent on the device.\r\n - WebRTC (used for real-time communication like video chats, i.e. Zoom, for example) can now use H.265/HEVC (recent upstream Chromium feature) on devices without hardware decoding support (Thorium feature). This is good because H.265 compression means that you will have less stuttery streams if you are on a bandwidth limited connection.\r\n - Fingerprinting protection patch added. Note this isn't a safety blanket, and doesn't mean Thorium will remove all types of fingerprint tracking it just makes it better than normal Chromium/Chrome. I would like to expand on this in the next version by adding a setting to enable the [Global Privacy Control](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/faq) header, alongside the \"Do Not Track\" setting, which is also enabled by default in Thorium.\r\n - Added flag to enable/disable Side Panel Journeys, which can be annoying. `chrome://flags#side-panel-journeys`\r\n - Added flag to enable/disable showing the built in internal extensions that are normally hidden. They are now hidden by default (like in normal Chromium), but can be re-enabled with `chrome://flags#show-component-extension-options`. I did this because I was getting too many issues with people wondering what they are, why they couldn't be removed, and if they were a security concern. These extensions are built in to every Chromium browser. Disabling them would remove support for the Web Store, viewing PDFs, and integrating with Google Hangouts. I added a patch from UnGoogled Chromium a while back to un-hide them, but it has led to more confusion than it is worth. Since most people don't care, they are now hidden again, but the flag is for people who want to inspect or debug them, or just want the transparency of showing *all* extensions that are loaded in the browser.\r\n - __*FTP support restored!*__ Chromium and Firefox both removed all support for `ftp://` URLs back in 2021. This has always annoyed me, because alot of ftp servers are still around, and alot of old software is only downloadable from ftp servers. In addition, tools like wget and curl wont download from them by default. This made it really convoluted to download files from an ftp website, usually making the user have to download a third party app. FTP means \"File Transfer Protocol\", and it was used heavily on the web for serving download directories to people (Microsoft used to host updates on an ftp site, for example). Learn more about it [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol). <br>It is enabled by default, but can also be disabled by the restored flag `chrome://flags/#enable-ftp`. There are two minor bugs though. First, favicons don't work, so when you are on an ftp site, the tab will show the \"dino\" icon usually used when a site is not reachable. Second, directly clicking links doesn't work, and will instead land you on an \"about:blank#blocked\" page. To go to an ftp site, right click the link, and select \"Copy link address\", and then open a new tab, paste the link in the address bar, and press enter. I hope to resolve these in the next version. This makes Thorium the *only modern browser* that supports FTP anymore. Thorium also now registers as an FTP URL handler with the OS, but I have not tested if opening an ftp url in an external app will cause Thorium to open it correctly, or land you on that \"about:blank#blocked\" page. Feedback is requested. Thanks to @win32ss for modernizing some of the code, since obviously stuff has changed alot in the Chromium repo since 2021.

changes in version 19:\r\n\r\n* avoid crash from unhandled exception in PDF date parsing for displaying metadata (was not a regression in version 18)\r\n* update eslint to 0.21.1\r\n* avoid false positive lint checks\r\n\r\nA full list of changes from the previous release (version 18) is available through the [Git commit log between the releases](https://github.com/GrapheneOS/PdfViewer/compare/18...19).\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nSimple Android PDF viewer based on pdf.js and content providers. The app doesn't require any permissions. The PDF stream is fed into the sandboxed WebView without giving it access to content or files. Content-Security-Policy is used to enforce that the JavaScript and styling properties within the WebView are entirely static content from the apk assets. It reuses the hardened Chromium rendering stack while only exposing a tiny subset of the attack surface compared to actual web content. The PDF rendering code itself is memory safe with dynamic code evaluation disabled, and even if an attacker did gain code execution by exploiting the underlying web rendering engine, they're within the Chromium renderer sandbox with no access to the network (unlike a browser), files, or other content.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThis app is [available through the Play Store with the `app.grapheneos.pdfviewer.play` app id](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.grapheneos.pdfviewer.play). Play Store releases go through review and it usually takes around 1 to 3 days before the Play Store pushes out the update to users. Play Store releases use Play Signing, so we use a separate app id from the releases we publish ourselves to avoid conflicts and to distinguish between them. Each release is initially pushed out through the Beta channel followed by the Stable channel.\r\n\r\nReleases of the app signed by GrapheneOS with the `app.grapheneos.pdfviewer` id are published in the GrapheneOS app repository and on GitHub. These releases are also bundled as part of GrapheneOS. You can use the [GrapheneOS app repository client](https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Apps/releases) on Android 12 or later for automatic updates. Each release is initially pushed out through the Alpha channel, followed by the Beta channel and then finally the Stable channel.\r\n\r\n**GrapheneOS users must either obtain GrapheneOS app updates through our app repository or install it with `adb install-multiple` with both the APK and fs-verity metadata since fs-verity metadata is now required for out-of-band system app updates on GrapheneOS as part of extending verified boot to them.**\r\n","overrideSource":null,"allowIdChange":false}]}
